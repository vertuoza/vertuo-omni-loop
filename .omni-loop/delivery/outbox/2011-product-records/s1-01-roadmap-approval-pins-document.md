## The question, in plain words

When a person approves a roadmap on its page, what does the approval cover, and which slice teaches the database to accept it?

## The decision, in plain words

The database now accepts an approval of a roadmap born on the server, and the approval covers the roadmap document alone: a change to the document cancels it, while the rows moving forward as work progresses do not.

## The intro, for fun

A roadmap wants a seal before anyone builds from it.

## The punchline, for fun

The seal sticks to the plan, not to every tick of progress.

## The options, in plain words

A. The approval covers the roadmap document alone, and this slice lets the database accept it (as built)
B. The approval also covers the rows, so any change of a row's progress cancels it
C. Leave approval out of this slice and let the page's slice add it to the database

## What I had to decide

Whether a roadmap approval covers only roadmap.md, as built, or also its PRD rows, human work and prerequisites; and whether s1, the only slice of landing 1 that may touch the database, was the right place to let dossier_approve() take a roadmap.

## What I did meanwhile

dossier_approve() approves a product roadmap pinning its latest roadmap.md; roadmap_product_push() voids that approval when roadmap.md changes, and only then. approvals.files now holds at least one file (a PRD's approval still pins three or four), and approval_voids.kind takes roadmap. dossier_approval() and approval_request(), which find a PRD by repository or product key, do not find a roadmap yet.

## What it costs to change later

A constant: pinning more kinds is a few lines in dossier_approve() and roadmap_product_push(), in a follow-up migration, before any roadmap is approved.

## What I could not know

(author) The PRD, the registers and the glossary do not settle this:

- The spec says a roadmap is approved on its page with the seal of #1299/#1612, but not what the seal pins; s3, which builds the page, has no migration in its territory (author)
- dossier_approval() and approval_request() still look up PRDs only: a roadmap's approval is read from the approvals table by its dossier until a slice needs more (author)
