# Critique

### Purpose

Resolve one stable target, run two independent assessments, and synthesise a design critique
against the product's design form: does this screen read as this product? Typed by a person, the
report is the deliverable, and it ends on targeted questions. Followed by `review`, it is that
review's step 1: no question is asked, and its priority issues feed the polish batch.

### Rules

- Assessment A (design review) and Assessment B (lint and screenshot evidence) are both required.
- Run A and B as two isolated helper agents when the session can start one; otherwise run A to the
  end and record it before B starts. The report's first line says which:
  `Method: two assessments apart` or `Method: one context, A before B (<reason>)`.
- Assessment A finishes before any lint finding enters the synthesis: a lint result is
  deterministic, but it still anchors judgement.
- A viewable target is looked at through the session's browser tool when it has one. When the app
  cannot run or be seen here, say so, and report nothing as seen.
- A local server started only to look at the target runs in the background, with a recorded way
  to stop it, and is stopped before the report.
- Typed by a person, the question is the last thing in the response: the whole report first, then
  the questions, nothing after them. A run that ends with neither the questions nor a literal
  `Questions skipped: <reason>` line is incomplete.

### Setup

1. **Resolve the target** to a concrete source file or route. Prefer a source path over a dev
   server address when both name the same screen: ports drift, paths do not.
   - "the homepage" -> the page's source file
   - "the settings modal" -> its primary component file
   - "this page" -> the current route or source file
2. **Read the design form** (Step 0 of the skill has: `omni kb show design`). Its `product`
   section is who the screen is for and in what words; its `system` section, which tokens and
   components the screen should use; its `deliberate` section, what is not a finding; its
   `language` section, the laws the screen keeps (a law broken is a finding, a law a person locked
   is never redesigned).

### Assessment A: Design Review

Read the relevant source files and look at the live screen when the session can. Think like a
design director who knows this product.

Evaluate:
- **Design specificity**: is the composition, interaction and visual language grounded in this
  product, its tokens and components, or could an unrelated product use it unchanged? Make this
  judgement before seeing any lint output.
- **Holistic design**: hierarchy, information architecture, emotional fit, discoverability,
  composition, typography, colour, accessibility, states, copy and edge cases.
- **Cognitive load**: consult the [Cognitive Load Assessment](#cognitive-load-assessment) section
  below; report checklist failures and decision points with more than 4 visible options.
- **Emotional journey**: peak-end rule, emotional valleys, reassurance at high-stakes moments.
- **Nielsen heuristics**: consult the [Heuristics Scoring Guide](#heuristics-scoring-guide) section
  below; score all 10 heuristics 0-4, marking any heuristic the mode rule allows as `n/a` instead of
  forcing a number.

Return: design-specificity verdict, heuristic scores, cognitive load, emotional journey, 2-3
strengths, 3-5 priority issues, persona red flags, minor observations, and questions to consider.

### Assessment B: Lint and Screenshot Evidence

1. **Lint:** run `commands.design` (`node .omni-loop/bin/omni.mjs config commands.design`) from the
   repository root when it is set, on the target's files when it takes paths. When it prints
   `null`, record `Design lint: not set here` and go on.
2. **Screenshots:** with the session's browser tool, open the target in a new tab of its own and
   capture it at the widths of the form's `review` section (390 and 1440 when it names none),
   signed in as it says. For a target with several views, capture 3-5 representative ones.

Return: the lint's findings and counts (or the line that it is not set), the screenshots taken, the
false positives, and every step skipped or failed with its concrete reason.

### Generate Combined Critique Report

Synthesise both assessments into a single report. Do not simply concatenate. Weave the findings
together, noting where the review and the lint agree, where the lint caught what the review missed,
and where a lint finding is a false positive or a choice the form's `deliberate` section explains.

Typed by a person, present the full structured critique below in the response; do not replace it
with a summary. Followed by `review`, keep it for the polish batch and the **Design review** line.

#### Report header

The report's first line is the method line (see Rules).

#### Design Health Score
> *Consult the [Heuristics Scoring Guide](#heuristics-scoring-guide) section below.*

Present the Nielsen's 10 heuristics scores as a table:

| # | Heuristic | Score | Key Issue |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | ? | [specific finding or "n/a" if solid] |
| 2 | Match System / Real World | ? | |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | ? | |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | ? | |
| 5 | Error Prevention | ? | |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | ? | |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency | ? | |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | ? | |
| 9 | Error Recovery | ? | |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | ? | |
| **Total** | | **??/[applicable max]** | **[Rating band]** |

The applicable maximum is 4 times the number of heuristics you actually scored: **/40** when all
ten apply, **/32** when two are `n/a`. Never print `/40` over a partial set.

Be honest with scores. A 4 means genuinely excellent. Most real interfaces score 20-32 out of 40.

**Mode applicability**: heuristics 7 (Flexibility and Efficiency) and 10 (Help and Documentation)
may be scored `n/a` on Persuade and Experience screens (landing pages, campaigns, portfolios), as
may any other heuristic that genuinely cannot apply to the screen under review. Write `n/a` in the
Score cell with a one-line reason, and renormalise the total to the applicable maximum (e.g.
**24/32** when two heuristics are n/a) so the rating band stays proportional.

#### Design Specificity Verdict

**Start here.** Does the result read as authored for this product, or category-interchangeable?

**Review**: your unanchored evaluation of design specificity against the design form: overall
coherence, the product's tokens and components used or bypassed, structural sameness,
category-interchangeable choices, and missed chances for the product's own character.

**Lint**: what `commands.design` found, with counts and file locations, what it caught that the
review missed, and its false positives. Or `Design lint: not set here`.

#### Overall Impression
A brief gut reaction: what works, what doesn't, and the single biggest opportunity.

#### What's Working
Highlight 2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

#### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance.

For each issue, tag with **P0-P3 severity** (see [Issue Severity below](#issue-severity-p0p3)):
- **[P?] What**: name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: how this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: what to do about it (be concrete)
- **Suggested command**: which command could address this (from: `/omni:pixel-perfect adapt`,
  `audit`, `clarify`, `critique`, `harden`, `layout`, `polish`, `typeset`)

#### Persona Red Flags
> *Consult the [Personas reference](#persona-based-design-testing) below.*

Auto-select 2-3 personas most relevant to this interface type (use the selection table in the
reference). When the design form's `product` section describes who uses the product, also derive
1-2 personas from it (see [Project-Specific Personas](#project-specific-personas)).

For each selected persona, walk through the primary user action and list specific red flags found:

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard shortcuts detected. Form requires 8 clicks for primary action.
Forced modal onboarding. High abandonment risk.

**Jordan (First-Timer)**: Icon-only nav in sidebar. Technical jargon in error messages ("404 Not
Found"). No visible help. Will abandon at step 2.

Be specific. Name the exact elements and interactions that fail each persona. Don't write generic
persona descriptions; write what broke for them.

#### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

#### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like, in this product's world?"

**Remember**:
- Be direct. Vague feedback wastes everyone's time.
- Be specific. "The submit button," not "some elements."
- Say what's wrong AND why it matters to users.
- Give concrete suggestions. Cut "consider exploring..." entirely.
- Prioritise ruthlessly. If everything is important, nothing is.
- Don't soften criticism: honest feedback is what lets the screen ship well.

### Ask the Person

Followed by `review`, skip this section: nothing is asked, and the priority issues go to the polish
batch.

Typed by a person, after the report, ask targeted questions based on what was actually found,
through the session's question tool, in the same response as the report, the report first and the
questions last:

1. **Priority direction**: which category of the issues found matters most right now. Offer the
   top 2-3 issue categories as options.
2. **Design intent**: if the critique found a tonal mismatch with the form's `product` section, ask
   whether it was intentional, and offer 2-3 directions that would fix it.
3. **Scope**: "I found N issues. Address everything, or the top 3?" Offer scope options.
4. **Constraints** (only when the findings touch many areas): should any part stay as it is?

**Rules for questions**:
- Every question references specific findings from the report. Never a generic "who is your
  audience?": the design form answers that.
- 2-4 questions at most, each with 2-3 concrete options.
- Skipping is allowed only when the report listed **fewer than 3 Priority Issues**; then print the
  literal line `Questions skipped: <reason>`, naming the count.

### Recommended Actions

After the answers, present a prioritised action summary reflecting the person's priorities and
scope:

1. **`/omni:pixel-perfect <command>`**: what to fix (specific context from the critique)
2. **`/omni:pixel-perfect <command>`**: what to fix (specific context)

**Rules for recommendations**:
- Only recommend commands from: `adapt`, `audit`, `clarify`, `critique`, `harden`, `layout`,
  `polish`, `typeset`.
- Order by the person's stated priorities first, then by impact.
- Each item carries enough context that the command knows what to focus on.
- Map each Priority Issue to a command; skip commands that would address none.
- Respect the chosen scope, and exclude areas marked off-limits.
- End with `/omni:pixel-perfect polish` as the final step if any fixes were recommended.

Then say that they can be run one at a time, all at once or in any order, and that a second
critique after the fixes shows whether the score moved.

## Reference Material

The sections below hold the critique's deep context in one place: cognitive load, the heuristics
scoring guide and the personas.

### Cognitive Load Assessment

Cognitive load is the total mental effort required to use an interface. Overloaded users make mistakes, get frustrated, and leave. This reference helps identify and fix cognitive overload.

---

#### Three Types of Cognitive Load

##### Intrinsic Load: The Task Itself
Complexity inherent to what the user is trying to do. You can't eliminate this, but you can structure it.

**Manage it by**:
- Breaking complex tasks into discrete steps
- Providing scaffolding (templates, defaults, examples)
- Progressive disclosure: show what's needed now, hide the rest
- Grouping related decisions together

##### Extraneous Load: Bad Design
Mental effort caused by poor design choices. **Eliminate this ruthlessly.** It's pure waste.

**Common sources**:
- Confusing navigation that requires mental mapping
- Unclear labels that force users to guess meaning
- Visual clutter competing for attention
- Inconsistent patterns that prevent learning
- Unnecessary steps between user intent and result

##### Germane Load: Learning Effort
Mental effort spent building understanding. This is *good* cognitive load; it leads to mastery.

**Support it by**:
- Progressive disclosure that reveals complexity gradually
- Consistent patterns that reward learning
- Feedback that confirms correct understanding
- Onboarding that teaches through action, not walls of text

---

#### Cognitive Load Checklist

Evaluate the interface against these 8 items:

- [ ] **Single focus**: Can the user complete their primary task without distraction from competing elements?
- [ ] **Chunking**: Is information presented in digestible groups (≤4 items per group)?
- [ ] **Grouping**: Are related items visually grouped together (proximity, borders, shared background)?
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy**: Is it immediately clear what's most important on the screen?
- [ ] **One thing at a time**: Can the user focus on a single decision before moving to the next?
- [ ] **Minimal choices**: Are decisions simplified (≤4 visible options at any decision point)?
- [ ] **Working memory**: Does the user need to remember information from a previous screen to act on the current one?
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure**: Is complexity revealed only when the user needs it?

**Scoring**: Count the failed items. 0–1 failures = low cognitive load (good). 2–3 = moderate (address soon). 4+ = high cognitive load (critical fix needed).

---

#### The Working Memory Rule

**Humans can hold ≤4 items in working memory at once** (Miller's Law revised by Cowan, 2001).

At any decision point, count the number of distinct options, actions, or pieces of information a user must simultaneously consider:
- **≤4 items**: Within working memory limits, manageable
- **5–7 items**: Pushing the boundary; consider grouping or progressive disclosure
- **8+ items**: Overloaded; users will skip, misclick, or abandon

**Practical applications**:
- Action buttons: 1 primary, 1–2 secondary, group the rest in a menu
- Navigation menus: ≤5 top-level items (group the rest under clear categories)
- Long-form articles: one reading path; gather related links into a single block at the end instead of scattering them mid-flow
- Documentation sidebars: ≤4 sibling choices visible per level before grouping kicks in
- Portfolio and gallery indexes: one decision per screen (which piece to open), not filter, sort, and tag controls all at once

---

#### Common Cognitive Load Violations

##### 1. The Wall of Options
**Problem**: Presenting 10+ choices at once with no hierarchy.
**Fix**: Group into categories, highlight recommended, use progressive disclosure.

##### 2. The Memory Bridge
**Problem**: User must remember info from step 1 to complete step 3.
**Fix**: Keep relevant context visible, or repeat it where it's needed.

##### 3. The Hidden Navigation
**Problem**: User must build a mental map of where things are.
**Fix**: Always show current location (breadcrumbs, active states, progress indicators).

##### 4. The Jargon Barrier
**Problem**: Technical or domain language forces translation effort.
**Fix**: Use plain language. If domain terms are unavoidable, define them inline.

##### 5. The Visual Noise Floor
**Problem**: Every element has the same visual weight; nothing stands out.
**Fix**: Establish clear hierarchy: one primary element, 2–3 secondary, everything else muted.

##### 6. The Inconsistent Pattern
**Problem**: Similar actions work differently in different places.
**Fix**: Standardize interaction patterns. Same type of action = same type of UI.

##### 7. The Multi-Task Demand
**Problem**: Interface requires processing multiple simultaneous inputs (reading + deciding + navigating).
**Fix**: Sequence the steps. Let the user do one thing at a time.

##### 8. The Context Switch
**Problem**: User must jump between screens/tabs/modals to gather info for a single decision.
**Fix**: Co-locate the information needed for each decision. Reduce back-and-forth.

### Heuristics Scoring Guide

Score each of Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics on a 0–4 scale. Be honest: a 4 means genuinely excellent, not "good enough."

#### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

##### 1. Visibility of System Status

Keep users informed about what's happening through timely, appropriate feedback.

**Check for**:
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Confirmation of user actions (save, submit, delete)
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Current location in navigation (breadcrumbs, active states)
- Form validation feedback (inline, not just on submit)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No feedback; user is guessing what happened |
| 1 | Rare feedback; most actions produce no visible response |
| 2 | Partial; some states communicated, major gaps remain |
| 3 | Good; most operations give clear feedback, minor gaps |
| 4 | Excellent; every action confirms, progress is always visible |

##### 2. Match Between System and Real World

Speak the user's language. Follow real-world conventions. Information appears in natural, logical order.

**Check for**:
- Familiar terminology (no unexplained jargon)
- Logical information order matching user expectations
- Recognizable icons and metaphors
- Domain-appropriate language for the target audience
- Natural reading flow (left-to-right, top-to-bottom priority)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Pure tech jargon, alien to users |
| 1 | Mostly confusing; requires domain expertise to navigate |
| 2 | Mixed; some plain language, some jargon leaks through |
| 3 | Mostly natural; occasional term needs context |
| 4 | Speaks the user's language fluently throughout |

##### 3. User Control and Freedom

Users need a clear "emergency exit" from unwanted states without extended dialogue.

**Check for**:
- Undo/redo functionality
- Cancel buttons on forms and modals
- Clear navigation back to safety (home, previous)
- Easy way to clear filters, search, selections
- Escape from long or multi-step processes

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Users get trapped; no way out without refreshing |
| 1 | Difficult exits; must find obscure paths to escape |
| 2 | Some exits; main flows have escape, edge cases don't |
| 3 | Good control; users can exit and undo most actions |
| 4 | Full control; undo, cancel, back, and escape everywhere |

##### 4. Consistency and Standards

Users shouldn't wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**Check for**:
- Consistent terminology throughout the interface
- Same actions produce same results everywhere
- Platform conventions followed (standard UI patterns)
- Visual consistency (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Consistent interaction patterns (same gesture = same behavior)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Inconsistent everywhere; feels like different products stitched together |
| 1 | Many inconsistencies; similar things look/behave differently |
| 2 | Partially consistent; main flows match, details diverge |
| 3 | Mostly consistent; occasional deviation, nothing confusing |
| 4 | Fully consistent; cohesive system, predictable behavior |

##### 5. Error Prevention

Better than good error messages is a design that prevents problems in the first place.

**Check for**:
- Confirmation before destructive actions (delete, overwrite)
- Constraints preventing invalid input (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Smart defaults that reduce errors
- Clear labels that prevent misunderstanding
- Autosave and draft recovery

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Errors easy to make; no guardrails anywhere |
| 1 | Few safeguards; some inputs validated, most aren't |
| 2 | Partial prevention; common errors caught, edge cases slip |
| 3 | Good prevention; most error paths blocked proactively |
| 4 | Excellent; errors nearly impossible through smart constraints |

##### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimize memory load. Make objects, actions, and options visible or easily retrievable.

**Check for**:
- Visible options (not buried in hidden menus)
- Contextual help when needed (tooltips, inline hints)
- Recent items and history
- Autocomplete and suggestions
- Labels on icons (not icon-only navigation)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Heavy memorization; users must remember paths and commands |
| 1 | Mostly recall; many hidden features, few visible cues |
| 2 | Some aids; main actions visible, secondary features hidden |
| 3 | Good recognition; most things discoverable, few memory demands |
| 4 | Everything discoverable; users never need to memorize |

##### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Accelerators, invisible to novices, speed up expert interaction.

**Check for**:
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Customizable interface elements
- Recent items and favorites
- Bulk/batch actions
- Power user features that don't complicate the basics

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | One rigid path; no shortcuts or alternatives |
| 1 | Limited flexibility; few alternatives to the main path |
| 2 | Some shortcuts; basic keyboard support, limited bulk actions |
| 3 | Good accelerators; keyboard nav, some customization |
| 4 | Highly flexible; multiple paths, power features, customizable |

##### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information. Every element should serve a purpose.

**Check for**:
- Only necessary information visible at each step
- Clear visual hierarchy directing attention
- Purposeful use of color and emphasis
- No decorative clutter competing for attention
- Focused, uncluttered layouts

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Overwhelming; everything competes for attention equally |
| 1 | Cluttered; too much noise, hard to find what matters |
| 2 | Some clutter; main content clear, periphery noisy |
| 3 | Mostly clean; focused design, minor visual noise |
| 4 | Perfectly minimal; every element earns its pixel |

##### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should use plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Check for**:
- Plain language error messages (no error codes for users)
- Specific problem identification ("Email is missing @" not "Invalid input")
- Actionable recovery suggestions
- Errors displayed near the source of the problem
- Non-blocking error handling (don't wipe the form)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Cryptic errors; codes, jargon, or no message at all |
| 1 | Vague errors; "Something went wrong" with no guidance |
| 2 | Clear but unhelpful; names the problem but not the fix |
| 3 | Clear with suggestions; identifies problem and offers next steps |
| 4 | Perfect recovery; pinpoints issue, suggests fix, preserves user work |

##### 10. Help and Documentation

Even if the system is usable without docs, help should be easy to find, task-focused, and concise.

**Check for**:
- Searchable help or documentation
- Contextual help (tooltips, inline hints, guided tours)
- Task-focused organization (not feature-organized)
- Concise, scannable content
- Easy access without leaving current context

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No help available anywhere |
| 1 | Help exists but hard to find or irrelevant |
| 2 | Basic help; FAQ or docs exist, not contextual |
| 3 | Good documentation; searchable, mostly task-focused |
| 4 | Excellent contextual help; right info at the right moment |

---

#### Score Summary

**Total possible**: 40 points (10 heuristics × 4 max)

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 36–40 | Excellent | Minor polish only; ship it |
| 28–35 | Good | Address weak areas, solid foundation |
| 20–27 | Acceptable | Significant improvements needed before users are happy |
| 12–19 | Poor | Major UX overhaul required; core experience broken |
| 0–11 | Critical | Redesign needed; unusable in current state |

When heuristics were scored `n/a`, the maximum is lower than 40; read the band off the percentage instead of the raw number (90%+ Excellent, 70%+ Good, 50%+ Acceptable, 30%+ Poor, below that Critical). 24/32 is 75%, so Good.

---

#### Issue Severity (P0–P3)

Tag each individual issue found during scoring with a priority level:

| Priority | Name | Description | Action |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Blocking | Prevents task completion entirely | Fix immediately; this is a showstopper |
| **P1** | Major | Causes significant difficulty or confusion | Fix before release |
| **P2** | Minor | Annoyance, but workaround exists | Fix in next pass |
| **P3** | Polish | Nice-to-fix, no real user impact | Fix if time permits |

**Tip**: If you're unsure between two levels, ask: "Would a user contact support about this?" If yes, it's at least P1.

---

### Persona-Based Design Testing

Test the interface through the eyes of 5 distinct user archetypes. Each persona exposes different failure modes that a single "design director" perspective would miss.

**How to use**: Select 2–3 personas most relevant to the interface being critiqued. Walk through the primary user action as each persona. Report specific red flags, not generic concerns.

---

#### 1. Impatient Power User: "Alex"

**Profile**: Expert with similar products. Expects efficiency, hates hand-holding. Will find shortcuts or leave.

**Behaviors**:
- Skips all onboarding and instructions
- Looks for keyboard shortcuts immediately
- Tries to bulk-select, batch-edit, and automate
- Gets frustrated by required steps that feel unnecessary
- Abandons if anything feels slow or patronizing

**Test Questions**:
- Can Alex complete the core task in under 60 seconds?
- Are there keyboard shortcuts for common actions?
- Can onboarding be skipped entirely?
- Do modals have keyboard dismiss (Esc)?
- Is there a "power user" path (shortcuts, bulk actions)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Forced tutorials or unskippable onboarding
- No keyboard navigation for primary actions
- Slow animations that can't be skipped
- One-item-at-a-time workflows where batch would be natural
- Redundant confirmation steps for low-risk actions

---

#### 2. Confused First-Timer: "Jordan"

**Profile**: Never used this type of product. Needs guidance at every step. Will abandon rather than figure it out.

**Behaviors**:
- Reads all instructions carefully
- Hesitates before clicking anything unfamiliar
- Looks for help or support constantly
- Misunderstands jargon and abbreviations
- Takes the most literal interpretation of any label

**Test Questions**:
- Is the first action obviously clear within 5 seconds?
- Are all icons labeled with text?
- Is there contextual help at decision points?
- Does terminology assume prior knowledge?
- Is there a clear "back" or "undo" at every step?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Icon-only navigation with no labels
- Technical jargon without explanation
- No visible help option or guidance
- Ambiguous next steps after completing an action
- No confirmation that an action succeeded

---

#### 3. Accessibility-Dependent User: "Sam"

**Profile**: Uses screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA), keyboard-only navigation. May have low vision, motor impairment, or cognitive differences.

**Behaviors**:
- Tabs through the interface linearly
- Relies on ARIA labels and heading structure
- Cannot see hover states or visual-only indicators
- Needs adequate color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- May use browser zoom up to 200%

**Test Questions**:
- Can the entire primary flow be completed keyboard-only?
- Are all interactive elements focusable with visible focus indicators?
- Do images have meaningful alt text?
- Is color contrast WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 for text)?
- Does the screen reader announce state changes (loading, success, errors)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Click-only interactions with no keyboard alternative
- Missing or invisible focus indicators
- Meaning conveyed by color alone (red = error, green = success)
- Unlabeled form fields or buttons
- Time-limited actions without extension option
- Custom components that break screen reader flow

---

#### 4. Deliberate Stress Tester: "Riley"

**Profile**: Methodical user who pushes interfaces beyond the happy path. Tests edge cases, tries unexpected inputs, and probes for gaps in the experience.

**Behaviors**:
- Tests edge cases intentionally (empty states, long strings, special characters)
- Submits forms with unexpected data (emoji, RTL text, very long values)
- Tries to break workflows by navigating backwards, refreshing mid-flow, or opening in multiple tabs
- Looks for inconsistencies between what the UI promises and what actually happens
- Documents problems methodically

**Test Questions**:
- What happens at the edges (0 items, 1000 items, very long text)?
- Do error states recover gracefully or leave the UI in a broken state?
- What happens on refresh mid-workflow? Is state preserved?
- Are there features that appear to work but produce broken results?
- How does the UI handle unexpected input (emoji, special chars, paste from Excel)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Features that appear to work but silently fail or produce wrong results
- Error handling that exposes technical details or leaves UI in a broken state
- Empty states that show nothing useful ("No results" with no guidance)
- Workflows that lose user data on refresh or navigation
- Inconsistent behavior between similar interactions in different parts of the UI

---

#### 5. Distracted Mobile User: "Casey"

**Profile**: Using phone one-handed on the go. Frequently interrupted. Possibly on a slow connection.

**Behaviors**:
- Uses thumb only; prefers bottom-of-screen actions
- Gets interrupted mid-flow and returns later
- Switches between apps frequently
- Has limited attention span and low patience
- Types as little as possible, prefers taps and selections

**Test Questions**:
- Are primary actions in the thumb zone (bottom half of screen)?
- Is state preserved if the user leaves and returns?
- Does it work on slow connections (3G)?
- Can forms use autocomplete and smart defaults?
- Are touch targets at least 44×44pt?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Important actions positioned at the top of the screen (unreachable by thumb)
- No state persistence; progress lost on tab switch or interruption
- Large text inputs required where selection would work
- Heavy assets loading on every page (no lazy loading)
- Tiny tap targets or targets too close together

---

#### Selecting Personas

Choose personas based on the interface type:

| Interface Type | Primary Personas | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Landing page / marketing | Jordan, Riley, Casey | First impressions, trust, mobile |
| Dashboard / admin | Alex, Sam | Power users, accessibility |
| E-commerce / checkout | Casey, Riley, Jordan | Mobile, edge cases, clarity |
| Onboarding flow | Jordan, Casey | Confusion, interruption |
| Data-heavy / analytics | Alex, Sam | Efficiency, keyboard nav |
| Form-heavy / wizard | Jordan, Sam, Casey | Clarity, accessibility, mobile |

#### Project-Specific Personas

When the design form's `product` section describes who uses the product, where and how, derive 1–2
additional personas from it:

1. Read who it says uses the product, where and under what conditions
2. Identify the primary user archetype not covered by the 5 predefined personas
3. Create a persona following this template:

```
##### [Role]: "[Name]"

**Profile**: [2-3 key characteristics taken from the design form]

**Behaviors**: [3-4 specific behaviors based on the described audience]

**Red Flags**: [3-4 things that would alienate this specific user type]
```

Only derive project-specific personas from what the form says. When its `product` section is a
`[hole]`, don't invent audience details; use the 5 predefined personas.
